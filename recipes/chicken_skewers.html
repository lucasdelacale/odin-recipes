            Directions

        <h4>
            Step 1
        </h4>
        <p>
            Gather all ingredients.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Step 2
        </h4>
        <p>
            For skewers, open pickle jar and transfer pickles to a small 
            bowl using a fork, leaving pickle juice in the jar. Set aside.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Step 3
        </h4>
        <p>
            In the jar with pickle juice, add brown sugar and 1 teaspoon salt; whisk 
            until dissolved. Add chicken to the jar, making sure all pieces are 
            submerged. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or up to 12 hours.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Step 4
        </h4>
        <p>
            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking 
            sheet with aluminum foil.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Step 5
        </h4>
        <p>
            Remove chicken pieces from pickle juice; discard juice. Thread 1 
            chicken piece followed by 3 pickle chips onto an 8-inch skewer; repeat 
            layers once, then finish with a third chicken piece. Continue threading 
            remaining chicken and pickles onto skewers as needed; reserve any extra 
            pickles for another use. Place skewers on the prepared baking sheet; pat 
            dry using paper towels. Evenly brush skewers with oil. Sprinkle chicken 
            pieces evenly with ranch dressing mix and remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt. 
        </p>
        <h4>
            Step 6
        </h4>
        <p>
            Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat until water sprinkled on immediately 
            sizzles. Grill skewers, pressing down on chicken as needed, just until marks 
            form on two sides, about 1 minute per side. Return skewers to baking sheet. 
        </p>
        <h4>
            Step 7
        </h4>
        <p>
            Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted 
            in the thickest part of the chicken registers at least 165 degrees F 
            (74 degrees C), 7 to 12 minutes. 
        </p>
        <h4>
            Step 8
        </h4>
        <p>
            Meanwhile, for sauce, melt 3 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over 
            medium heat; add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until butter 
            starts to brown and garlic is lightly golden, about 30 seconds. Remove 
            from heat; whisk in broth, ranch dressing mix, dill, and salt until well 
            combined. Whisk in remaining 1 tablespoon butter until melted and emulsified. 
        </p>
        <h4>
            Step 9
        </h4>
        <p>
            Transfer skewers to a serving plate; drizzle with sauce and serve 
            immediately. Garnish with more dill, if desired.
